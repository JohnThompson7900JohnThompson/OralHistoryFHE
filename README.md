# OralHistoryFHE

**OralHistoryFHE** is a **privacy-preserving research platform for sensitive oral history archives**, utilizing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to allow encrypted audio and text analysis without exposing confidential or politically sensitive information.  
The platform enables academic researchers to study historical testimonies, trauma narratives, and politically sensitive accounts while protecting the identity and privacy of interviewees.

---

## Project Background

Oral history archives often contain **extremely sensitive material**:

- **Traumatic Content:** Survivorsâ€™ recollections require strict confidentiality.  
- **Political Sensitivity:** Historical narratives may be restricted or risky to access openly.  
- **Research Limitations:** Researchers struggle to perform analytics without accessing raw, sensitive content.  
- **Ethical Compliance:** Institutions must balance accessibility with privacy and safety of participants.

**OralHistoryFHE** solves these issues by processing data in **encrypted form**, enabling ethical and secure analysis.

## Why FHE Matters

Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows computations on encrypted audio and textual data:

- **Secure Analysis:** Sentiment, thematic clustering, and keyword extraction are performed without decryption.  
- **Privacy by Design:** Interviewee identities remain protected even during research.  
- **Ethical Research:** Researchers gain insights while fully respecting confidentiality.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meets ethical and legal standards for handling sensitive archives.

FHE bridges the gap between **data usability and privacy**, enabling new scholarship while safeguarding participants.

## Architecture

### 1. Encrypted Archive Layer
- Oral history recordings and transcripts are encrypted before storage.  
- Only encrypted data is made available for research analysis.

### 2. Homomorphic Analysis Engine
- Performs computations directly on encrypted data using FHE algorithms:  
  - `FHE_Sentiment()` to detect emotions in speech or text  
  - `FHE_TopicModel()` to identify recurring themes  
  - `FHE_KeywordSearch()` for secure content discovery  
- Produces encrypted results accessible only to authorized researchers.

### 3. Research Interface
- Provides secure visualization tools and analytics dashboards.  
- Decrypts only aggregate insights while keeping individual interviews protected.  
- Interactive exploration of themes, sentiment trends, and historical connections.

### 4. Secure Collaboration Layer
- Multiple researchers can collaboratively perform analysis on encrypted archives.  
- Ensures that no participant data is ever exposed during joint research efforts.

## Example Workflow

1. Archivist encrypts oral history recordings and transcripts before storage.  
2. Researchers submit analysis requests to the FHE engine.  
3. FHE engine performs sentiment analysis, topic extraction, or pattern discovery on encrypted data.  
4. Encrypted results are returned to researchers.  
5. Researchers decrypt aggregated insights locally for study, while raw interview content remains confidential.  
6. Continuous updates allow new archives to be securely added without re-exposing prior data.

## Security Features

- **Encrypted Data Storage:** Audio and transcripts are always stored in encrypted form.  
- **Homomorphic Computation:** Analysis occurs without decryption, preventing accidental data exposure.  
- **Ethical Access Control:** Only authorized researchers can access results, ensuring compliance with ethical standards.  
- **Audit and Traceability:** All analysis requests and results are logged securely for accountability.

## Use Cases

1. **Trauma Research**
   - Analyze psychological and emotional patterns in survivor testimonies securely.

2. **Political History Studies**
   - Extract insights from politically sensitive archives without endangering interviewees.

3. **Cross-Archive Analysis**
   - Compare themes and trends across multiple collections while preserving privacy.

4. **Longitudinal Studies**
   - Track changes over time in speech patterns or sentiment from encrypted historical data.
